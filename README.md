# Simple Calculator in C#

## Overview

This is a basic calculator application built using C#. The program performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It provides a user-friendly interface and demonstrates fundamental concepts of C# programming, including event handling, UI design, and basic logic implementation.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add two numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply two numbers.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another, with error handling for division by zero.

## Technologies Used

- **C#**: The primary language for implementing the logic and user interface.
- **Windows Forms**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
  
## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YousryEssam/Simple-Calculater-with-CSharp.git
    ```

2. Open the project in Visual Studio or any compatible C# IDE.

3. Build and run the project.

4. The calculator window will appear. Enter values and select the operation you want to perform.

## Future Enhancements

- Adding support for more complex mathematical functions (e.g., square root, exponentiation).
- Implementing a history feature to track previous calculations.
- Improving the UI design for a better user experience.
